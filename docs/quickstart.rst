Quickstart
==========

You need `Docker <https://docker.io/>`_ installed.

#. Clone the repository.
#. Create a ``config.rb`` and a ``config.sh`` (use the included
   ``.example`` files as a template).
#. Build the container with ``./build-container.sh``
#. Start the program with ``./start.sh``

There is also a ``deploy.sh`` script which can be used to put the
finished program onto a server.
