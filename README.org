* What it does

This little program uses ~nmap~ to scan hosts for open ports and
compares the ports found open with a list of allowed open ports. If
there are ports found open which are not in the lost of allowed open
ports, it sends a mail.

It is useful when run periodically against your servers to check if
the firewalls are still configured properly.

* Quickstart

You need [[https://docker.io][Docker]] installed.

- Clone the repository.
- Create a ~config.rb~ and a ~config.sh~ (use the included ~.example~
  files as a template).
- Build the container with ~./build-container.sh~
- Start the program with ~./start.sh~

There is also a ~deploy.sh~ script which can be used to put the
finished program onto a server.
